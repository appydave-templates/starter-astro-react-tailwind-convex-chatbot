Excellent. With the roadmap finalized, I will now generate the complete Product Requirements Document based on our collaborative session.

This document contains the full breakdown of features, epics, and stories for the MVP. Please save this as `prd.md` in your `docs/` folder.

# AI-Accelerated Starter Template Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### **Goals and Background Context**

* **Goals**
    * To create a definitive, reusable template that dramatically accelerates your personal ability to build and launch your own AI-driven applications.
    * To provide a high-quality foundation for your YouTube content, effectively demonstrating a modern, AI-first development workflow.
    * To rigorously test and validate the "Context Engineer + AI Coder" development paradigm for personal productivity.

* **Background Context**
    This project is an AI-accelerated starter template for building sophisticated conversational and agent-based applications. It is designed for solo developers, entrepreneurs, and technical visionaries who want to leverage AI pair programming effectively. The core problem it solves is the immense friction and setup time required to build a modern, robust, and AI-ready application, allowing the creator to focus on innovation rather than boilerplate.

* **Change Log**
    | Date | Version | Description | Author |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | July 8, 2025 | 1.0 | Initial draft of the PRD. | John (PM) |

### **User Interface Design Goals**

* **Overall UX Vision:** To provide a clean, modern, and developer-focused UI that is both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional. The interface should feel fast, responsive, and intuitive.
* **Core Screens and Views:**
    * A public-facing landing page.
    * A protected dashboard page for authenticated users.
    * A primary conversational chat interface.
* **Branding:** Minimalist, professional, dark-mode-first aesthetic that is easily customizable.
* **Target Device and Platforms:** Web (Desktop & Mobile Responsive).

---
### **Technical Assumptions**

* **Repository Structure:** Monorepo managed with Turborepo.
* **Service Architecture:** Serverless architecture using Convex for the primary backend and Cloudflare Workers for custom server-side logic.
* **Testing Requirements:** A comprehensive testing strategy including unit (Vitest), E2E (Playwright), and an automated AI agent workflow for coverage enhancement.

## **Epic List**

* **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Setup**
    * **Goal:** To establish the complete, deployable project structure with all core tooling, a basic UI shell with theming, and a functioning CI/CD pipeline.
* **Epic 2: Authentication & Real-Time Data**
    * **Goal:** To implement a complete user authentication flow and demonstrate the core value of the real-time backend with a functional example application.
* **Epic 3: Conversational AI Implementation**
    * **Goal:** To implement a fully functional, end-to-end conversational chat feature that connects to a live LLM, providing the core interactive AI experience for the template.
* **Epic 4: In-App Code Generation & Context Framework**
    * **Goal:** To deliver the template's most advanced capability: a proof-of-concept for in-app, AI-driven code generation, supported by a formal set of "best practice" documents.

2. An `apps/web` package exists containing a minimal Astro application.
3. A `packages/` directory exists for future shared code.

#### **Story 1.2: Core Backend Setup (Convex)**
**As a** Context Engineer, **I want** the Convex backend initialized and connected to my frontend, **so that** the application has a live, real-time data layer.
*Acceptance Criteria:*
1. The `convex/` directory is initialized.
2. The database schema from the architecture document is implemented in `convex/schema.ts`.
3. The frontend application successfully connects to the Convex development server.

#### **Story 1.3: UI Foundation & Theming**
**As a** Context Engineer, **I want** a basic UI component library and a light/dark theme toggle implemented, **so that** future features can be built with a consistent look.
*Acceptance Criteria:*
1. ShadCN and TailwindCSS are installed and configured.
2. A functional light/dark mode toggle is implemented.
3. At least two essential UI components (e.g., Button, Card) are created in the `packages/ui` directory.

### **Checklist Results Report**

*This section will be populated after the `pm-checklist` has been executed against this document.*

### **Next Steps**

This PRD, along with the `architecture.md`, contains the complete plan for the MVP. These documents should be handed off to the **Scrum Master (Bob)**. His task is to begin the development cycle by using the `create-next-story` task to draft the first story (Story 1.1) from Epic 1.

```

This document provides the complete set of requirements for building the MVP. The next step is to save this as `prd.md` in your `docs/` folder and begin the development cycle with the Scrum Master.

My work in this session is complete. I will now revert to the **BMad Orchestrator**.
