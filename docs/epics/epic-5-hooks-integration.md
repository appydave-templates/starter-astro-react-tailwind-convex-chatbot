# Epic 5: Claude Code Hooks Integration - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal
Implement a comprehensive hooks system for the AI-accelerated starter template that enables automated code quality checks, custom notifications, and development workflow automation through Claude Code's hook capabilities.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context
- Current relevant functionality: AI-accelerated starter template with Astro frontend, Convex backend, and BMAD development methodology
- Technology stack: TypeScript, Bun, Astro, Convex, Vitest, Playwright, Turborepo
- Integration points: Development commands (turbo run dev/test/lint/build), file system operations, Git workflows

### Enhancement Details
- What's being added/changed: Adding Claude Code hooks configuration for automated formatting, linting, test execution, and custom development workflows
- How it integrates: Hooks will intercept Claude Code tool usage to enforce code quality, run tests automatically, and provide notifications
- Success criteria: Automated code formatting on file edits, blocked modifications to sensitive files, automatic test runs, and custom developer notifications

## Stories

1. **Story 5.1:** Core Hooks Configuration and Infrastructure - Set up hooks configuration file structure, create base hook commands, and implement PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks for code formatting
2. **Story 5.2:** Development Workflow Hooks - Implement hooks for automated testing, linting, and build verification when files are modified
3. **Story 5.3:** Security and Notification Hooks - Add hooks to protect sensitive files, implement custom notifications, and create Stop/SubagentStop hooks for cleanup

## Compatibility Requirements
- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (no DB changes)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (no UI changes)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation
- **Primary Risk:** Hooks could interfere with normal Claude Code operations or slow down development
- **Mitigation:** Make hooks configurable with enable/disable flags, implement timeouts, and provide bypass options
- **Rollback Plan:** Hooks can be disabled by removing or renaming the configuration file

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No regression in existing features

## Story Manager Handoff

Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:
- This is an enhancement to an existing system using Turborepo monorepo structure
- Integration points: turbo commands, .claude/ directory, existing test/lint/build scripts
- Existing patterns to follow: TypeScript strict mode, Bun runtime, existing error handling
- Critical compatibility requirements: Must work with Turborepo, respect monorepo boundaries
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering automated development workflow enhancements.
