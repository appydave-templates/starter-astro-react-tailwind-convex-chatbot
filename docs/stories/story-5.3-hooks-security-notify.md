# Story 5.3: Security and Notification Hooks

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** security hooks and custom notifications,
**so that** sensitive files are protected and I receive relevant development feedback

## Acceptance Criteria
1. PreToolUse hooks block modifications to sensitive files
2. Security patterns prevent accidental credential commits
3. Custom notification hooks provide development feedback
4. Stop/SubagentStop hooks perform cleanup tasks
5. Hook bypass mechanism exists for emergency situations
6. Audit trail tracks all hook interventions

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement security hooks (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create sensitive file protection list
  - [ ] Add credential scanning hooks
  - [ ] Configure environment file protection
- [ ] Build notification system (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create notification command infrastructure
  - [ ] Add success/failure notifications for builds
  - [ ] Implement custom notification templates
- [ ] Add cleanup hooks (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Configure Stop hooks for session cleanup
  - [ ] Add SubagentStop hooks for task completion
  - [ ] Implement temporary file cleanup
- [ ] Create bypass mechanism (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add `--no-hooks` flag support
  - [ ] Implement per-hook bypass options
  - [ ] Create emergency override configuration
- [ ] Set up audit system (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Log all hook interventions
  - [ ] Track bypass usage
  - [ ] Create security event reporting

## Dev Notes

### Hook Configuration Example
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "pattern": "**/.env*|**/secrets/**|**/*key*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo 'BLOCKED: Attempting to modify sensitive file'",
            "blockExecution": true
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "rm -rf .tmp .claude-cache"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Notification": [
      {
        "event": "build-complete",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo 'âœ… Build completed successfully'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Security Considerations
- Sensitive files: `.env*`, `**/secrets/`, `**/*key*`, `**/*token*`, `**/*password*`
- Credential patterns: API keys, tokens, passwords
- Use existing .gitignore patterns as baseline
- Integration with existing auth system (BetterAuth)
- Convex environment variables protection

### Notification Options
- Console output for CLI environments
- System notifications where available
- Log file entries for all events
- Integration with development workflow

### Dependencies
- Requires Story 5.1 to be completed (configuration infrastructure)
