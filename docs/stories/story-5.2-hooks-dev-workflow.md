# Story 5.2: Development Workflow Hooks

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** automated testing and linting hooks,
**so that** code quality is maintained automatically during development

## Acceptance Criteria
1. PreToolUse hooks prevent edits to files with failing tests
2. PostToolUse hooks run relevant tests after file modifications
3. Linting hooks execute on TypeScript/JavaScript file changes
4. Build verification hooks run after significant changes
5. Hooks respect file patterns and ignore lists
6. Performance impact is minimal (<2s for most operations)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement test execution hooks (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create pre-edit test verification hook
  - [x] Configure post-edit test runner for affected files
  - [x] Add test result caching for performance
- [x] Set up linting hooks (AC: 3)
  - [x] Configure ESLint/Biome linting on file changes
  - [x] Add TypeScript type checking hooks
  - [x] Implement auto-fix capabilities where safe
- [x] Create build verification hooks (AC: 4)
  - [x] Add incremental build checks
  - [x] Configure threshold for triggering full builds
  - [x] Implement build result notifications
- [x] Add pattern matching system (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create glob pattern support for file matching
  - [x] Implement ignore lists (.hookignore file)
  - [x] Add directory-specific hook configurations
- [x] Optimize performance (AC: 6)
  - [x] Implement parallel hook execution
  - [x] Add caching for repeated operations
  - [x] Create hook debouncing for rapid changes

## Dev Notes

### Hook Configuration Example
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "turbo run test --filter={workspace} --affected",
            "blockOnFailure": true
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "pattern": "**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "turbo run lint --filter={workspace}"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Testing Standards
- Test commands: `turbo run test` for unit tests
- Integration tests: `turbo run test:e2e`
- Vitest configuration in each workspace
- Tests follow existing patterns in `__tests__` directories

### Build Commands
- Frontend build: `turbo run build --filter=web`
- Full build: `turbo run build`
- Type checking: `turbo run typecheck`

### Dependencies
- Requires Story 5.1 to be completed (configuration infrastructure)

## Change Log
| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-07-08 | 1.0 | Initial story creation | BMad Master |
| 2025-07-09 | 1.1 | Story implementation completed | James (Dev) |

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude 3.5 Sonnet (James - Full Stack Developer)

### Debug Log References
- Log file: `.claude/hooks.log` - Contains execution logs for all development workflow hooks
